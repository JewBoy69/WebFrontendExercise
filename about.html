					The original habitats of the raccoon are deciduous and mixed forests, 
					but due to their adaptability, they have extended their range to mountainous
					areas, coastal marshes, and urban areas, where some homeowners consider them 
					to be pests. As a result of escapes and deliberate introductions in the mid-20th
					century, raccoons are now also distributed across much of mainland Europe, the 
					Caucasus, and Japan.Though previously thought to be generally solitary, there is 
					now evidence that raccoons engage in sex-specific social behavior. Related females 
					often share a common area, while unrelated males live together in groups of up to 
					four raccoons, in order to maintain their positions against foreign males during the
					mating season, and other potential invaders. Home range sizes vary anywhere from 3 hectares 
					(7.4 acres) for females in cities, to 5,000 hectares (12,000 acres) for males in prairies. 
					After a gestation period of about 65 days, two to five young, known as "kits", are born in 
					spring. The kits are subsequently raised by their mother until dispersal in late fall. Although 
					captive raccoons have been known to live over 20 years, their life expectancy in the wild is only 
					1.8 to 3.1 years. In many areas, hunting and vehicular injury are the two most common causes of death.
